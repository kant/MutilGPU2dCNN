# MutiltGPU_CNN
> This is an examples of how to use mutilGPU training

The is modify vgg16net for input image64x64x3 example based on tensorflow1.0

## How to Use
My Machine has two GTX1080.Train CNN on multiple GPUs, not only compute forward pass, but also compute backward pass, so use make_parallel function make data into two GPUs and get two GPUs results, then when minimize loss function set colocate_gtadients_with_ops flag to true.calculate two gpu lost value seperately, and merge them on cpu, minimize the loss function and update weight.
